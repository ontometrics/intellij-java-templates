intellij-java-templates
=======================

Templates for use in IntelliJ.

These are a bunch of live templates. We have used IntelliJ for straight Java and for android. The android templates are in a folder called android. General templates are in /user.

These files must be copied into:

    ~/Library/Preferences/<product name>/templates
    
When we were getting builds from the Canary Channel, it was AndroidStudioPreview, now starting with 0.8, it's AndroidStudioBeta.

So the complete path would be:

    ~/Library/Preferences/AndroidStudioBeta/templates

After copying the files in there, restart.
